# bekrin.me
This is source code of my personal website made with React. It supports hot
module replacement and possible to generate completely static web site.
 
### Develop
To start development process run `npm start`. It would launch webpack with HMR.

### Build
To generate static version of website run `npm run build`. Result bundle would
be under `./dist` folder.
